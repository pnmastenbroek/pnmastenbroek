### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Inspired by the large amount of data and the many possibilities to use it, I started to specialise myself in the area of data use and visualization. I have a job at TU Delft as a reporting specialist and Iâ€™m broadening my business skills. Privately I broaden my IT skills and data knowledge with online home trainings.

At the beginning of 2019 I followed the "Microsoft Professional Program for Data Science track" programme for 16 weeks full time, in the Johan Cruyff ArenA. Power BI, SQL, Python and Machine Learning were part of this study.

ðŸŒ± Currently Iâ€™m learning more about BO & BIP, these are workrelated. GitHub, Python & PowerBI, these have my personal interest and from November Tableau will be added to my work tools and I have a personal interest for it.

Creative, solution-oriented, motivated and passionate are words that describe me. Making timetables and meeting deadlines is a second nature for me. I have great perseverance. As soon as I start a task, I'll finish it. While performing the task I test the objective and adjust it where necessary. I am an open and honest person and love to broaden my knowledge continuously.

In my spare time I like to walk or read a book. Living actively, conscious and healthy is important to me. On a daily base Iâ€™m grateful for what I receive.
