### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Inspired by the large amount of data and the many possibilities to use it, I started a private retraining project in 2016 to specialize in visually displaying data. In addition to my working time, I have invested time in online home study, see the "Licenses & Certifications" section for all the details. 

At the beginning of 2019 I followed the "Microsoft Professional Program for Data Science track" programme for 16 weeks full time, in the Johan Cruyff ArenA. Power BI, SQL, Python and Machine Learning were part of this study.

Creative, solution-oriented, motivated and passionate are words that describe me. Making timetables and meeting deadlines is a second nature for me. I have great perseverance. As soon as I start a task, I'll finish it. While performing the task I test the objective and adjust it where necessary. I am an open and honest person and love to broaden my knowledge continuously.

ðŸŒ± Currently Iâ€™m learning more about BO & BIP, these are workrelated. GitHub, Python & PowerBI, these have my personal interest and from November Tableau will be added to my work tools and I have a personal interest for it.
